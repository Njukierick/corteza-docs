.[#2022_3_3-changed]#<<2022_3_3-changed,Changed:>>#
* Changed {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} user interface UX by adding spinners to indicate data loading ({WEBAPP_COMPOSE_COMMIT_BASE}11c7cf8[`#11c7cf8`]), changing calendar event cursor to pointer ({WEBAPP_COMPOSE_COMMIT_BASE}75cc346[`#75cc346`]), added additional exceptions for record list sorting and filtering to avoid strange behavior ({WEBAPP_JS_COMMIT_BASE}70c6277[`#70c6277`], {WEBAPP_COMPOSE_COMMIT_BASE}6826d19[`#6826d19`]), added a small delay when processing Record fields ({WEBAPP_COMPOSE_COMMIT_BASE}b6e722d[`#b6e722d`]).
* Changed chart font family to Poppins-Regular to make them consistent with the rest of the {PRODUCT_NAME} design ({WEBAPP_JS_COMMIT_BASE}0349363[`#0349363`]).
* Changed user authentication session and access token logic as well as updating corresponding `.env` variables and their descriptions ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}7f84994[`#7f84994`]).
Changed the authentication session and corresponding cookie to expire on session end when using "log in", and after the specified lifetime when using "login and remember me" ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}5fd5b93[`#5fd5b93`]).
Changed the "login and remember me" button to not show if the `AUTH_SESSION_PERM_LIFETIME` `.env` variable is set to 0 (disabling the feature) ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}ad53ea9[`#ad53ea9`])
* Changed the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} sidebar to show the link to all namespaces at the top of the dropdown.
This change allows the link to be visible even with many namespaces present ({COMPOSE_COMMIT_BASE}15ca4000[`#15ca4000`]).

.[#2022_3_3-removed]#<<2022_3_3-removed,Removed:>>#
* Removed the `AUTH_JWT_EXPIRY` `.env` variable because it is replaced by the `AUTH_OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME` `.env` variable ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}e626bcd[`#e626bcd`]).

.[#2022_3_3-fixed]#<<2022_3_3-fixed,Fixed:>>#
* Fixed broken {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} module export which caused `Record` fields to become unconfigurable after the module was imported ({WEBAPP_COMPOSE_COMMIT_BASE}1219112[`#1219112`]).
* Fixed invalid RBAC rule migration where a rule could use wildcards between resource IDs (invalid state).
A new migration step attempts to correct the broken RBAC rules ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}563a73c6[`563a73c6`]).
* Fixed improper workflow prompt handling when user has multiple {PRODUCT_NAME} instances (tabs) open at the same time.
{PRODUCT_NAME} web applications improved communication on what prompts are already resolved and where the prompts should be shown ({CORTEZA_WEBAPP_VUE_COMMIT_BASE}40e5416[`#40e5416`]).
* Fixed improper number and text setting value decoding by covering edge-cases ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}ced2daf[`#ced2daf`]).
* Fixed invalid valid JSONL files being rejected when importing records by adding additional fallback content-type checks to the preprocessing logic ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}f726d3f[`#f726d3f`]).
* Fixed improper record access control rule migration due to invalid paging ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}b6d13d9[`#b6d13d9`]).
* Fixed infinite loop webconsole alerts when offline ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}d8e57b1[`#d8e57b1`]).
* Fixed improper Federation URI node generation by including the API base URL ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}798c31e[`#798c31e`]).
* Fixed system healthcheck panic when {APP_AUTOMATION} connection is not available ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}2ff1108[`#2ff1108`]).
* Fixed broken module field value expressions where the `old` record reference was used.
The issue occurred because the value was never provided ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}7135903[`#7135903`]).

.[#2022_3_3-development]#<<2022_3_3-development,Development:>>#
* Including the web console bundle into the built corteza-server ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}54fffd0[`#54fffd0`]).
