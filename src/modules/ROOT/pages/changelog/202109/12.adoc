* Fixed improper credential validation on user registration causing the user to be created even when invalid credentials (mainly the password) was provided.
The fix moves the password validation step to the earlier stage of the sign up flow ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}ff13912[`#ff13912`]).
* Fixed improper record count for grouped reports where multi-value fields are involved.
The fix, for some cases, omits duplicate values ({SERVER_COMMIT_BASE}7546dbb[`7546dbb`]).
