= Multi-image Discovery with PostgreSQL
:page-noindex: true

[NOTE]
====
Currently Corteza Discovery is tested on a running production servers in combination with PostgreSQL database, but should work with the latest MySQL versions.
Beside the `server` and `db` containers, there should be also the indexer (`es`) and the searcher (`discovery`) running.
