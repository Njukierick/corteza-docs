= Expressions

{PRODUCT_NAME} defines an expression language which is used when defining xref:compose-configuration/index.adoc#field-expressions[field expressions], xref:automation/workflows/index.adoc[workflow steps], as well as xref:administrator-guide:access-control/index.adoc#role-type-ctx[contextual roles].

[NOTE]
====
Under the hood, we use https://github.com/PaesslerAG/gval[Gval] as the expression evaluation engine.
Refer to the official documentation for technical details.
====

== Syntax

.The most basic form of an expression would follow the following pattern:
[source]
----
<variable|constant|function> <operator> <variable|constant|function>
----

[NOTE]
====
In later texts, we alias the above string and its variations with `expression`.
====

.To examplify:
[source]
----
lead.values.totalCost / 10
----

You can expand the expression by applying additional constructs such as addition and division.

.To examplify:
[source]
----
average(min(lead.values.a, lead.values.b), abs(lead.values.c))
----

== Variables

The expression engine does *not* allow you to define custom variables within the expression itself.
All variables are defined by the system where the expression is being executed in.

The available variables are either documented in the system's user interface or in dedicated documentation pages.

== Objects

Objects allow you to encapsulate different bits of information into a single variable, such as a user, role, or record.

The primitive object-like data types include xref:expr/type-reference.adoc#datatype-kv[`KV`] and xref:expr/type-reference.adoc#datatype-kvv[`KVV`]; other component defined object-like data types can be found xref:expr/type-reference.adoc#object-reference[here]

.In the simplest form, an object is defined like so:
[source]
----
{
  "username": "testUser",
  "email": "test@mail.tld"
}
----

.If we would like to reference the entire object, we would reference the variable; for example:
[source]
----
newUser // results with { "username": "testUser", "email": "test@mail.tld" }
----

.If we would like to reference specific properties of the object, we would use a selector; for example:
[source]
----
newUser.username // results with "testUser"
newUser["email"] // results with "test@mail.tld"
----

[NOTE]
====
An object selector can use either the `[]` or the `.` notation.
====

=== Missing properties

[NOTE]

== Arrays

Arrays allow you to encapsulate a series of values into a single variable, such as a list of leads or contacts we would like to create.

xref:expr/type-reference.adoc#datatype-array[`Array`] is the only native array data type.
An array can contain any data type, including another array.

[TIP]
====
Nested arrays allow you to define a multidimensional matrix.
====

.In the simplest form, an array is defined like so:
[source]
----
[{
  "username": "testUser1",
  "email": "test+1@mail.tld"
}, {
  "username": "testUser2",
  "email": "test+2@mail.tld"
}]
----

.If we would like to reference the entire array, we would reference the variable; for example:
[source]
----
newUsers // results with [{ "username": "testUser1", "email": "test+1@mail.tld" }, { "username": "testUser2", "email": "test+2@mail.tld" }]
----

.If we would like to reference specific elements of the array, we would use a selector; for example:
[source]
----
newUser[0] // results with { "username": "testUser1", "email": "test+1@mail.tld" }
newUser[1] // results with { "username": "testUser2", "email": "test+2@mail.tld" }
----

.If we wanted to access a property of the object that is inside an array, we would add an object selector:
[source]
----
newUser[0]["email"] // results with "test+1@mail.tld"
----

[NOTE]
====
An array selector can only use the `[]` notation.

=== Order of execution

Expressions follow "the usual order" of execution where the order is initially based on *operator precedence* where the operators with equal precedence are executed *left to right*.

To examplify; the order of execution for the expression of `a + b + (c + d * e)` would be:

. `d * e` (`x1`)
. `c + x1` (`x2`)
. `a + b` (`x3`)
. `x3 + x2`

The execution order may be controlled by enclosing parts of the expression within brackets `()`.
