[#report-builder]
== Report Builder

The report builder is used to define the reports' structure using *report blocks* and a drag-and-drop interface.
Each report has a grid of 12 columns and is not limited on the vertical axis.

== Data Sources

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* reference to more examples.
====

A data source defines what resource is being accessed, how the data is pre-processed and presented to the reporter.
Most data sources may be used as the input to another data source.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A data source must define a name that is unique amongst other data sources defined by the current report and any of it's blocks.
====

We can define data sources on two levels: on the entire report and on a specific report block.

When defining data sources on the entire report, any of the blocks and its items should be able to access the data provided by the data source.
Such a data source should be used when we wish to define some pre-computed data which we will be using through the entire report.
Report-level data sources can be accessed by clicking on the btn:[Data sources] button in the top right corner of the <<report-builder,report builder>>.

When defining data sources on specific report blocks, only the items inside the given report block are able to access the data provided by the data source.
Such a data source should be used when you wish to additionally transform some pre-computed dat provided by report-level data sources.
Block-level data sources can be accessed by clicking on the "edit" icon of a certain block and navigating to the "data sources" section.

=== Load

The load data source allows you to access resources directly from {PRODUCT_NAME} such as your CRM leads.
Resources can be pre-filtered and presorted, which allows you to show data based on a specific characteristic such as a time span.

The source defines which {PRODUCT_NAME} resource provides data; for example "compose records".

.The example shows a load data source configuration.
image::reporter/load.png[role="data-zoomable"]

.Compose record source configuration options:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===
| [#ds-load-records-namespace]#<<ds-load-records-namespace,Namespace>>#
|
The namespace defines what {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} namespace is accessed; for example "CRM" or "Case Management".

| [#ds-load-records-module]#<<ds-load-records-module,Module>>#
|
The module defines what module is accessed; for example "lead" or "contact".

| [#ds-load-records-prefilter]#<<ds-load-records-prefilter,Pre-filter>>#
|
The pre-filter defines what filtering should be applied to the accessed data before the data source returns the data.
Pre-filtering allows you to show data based on the specified characteristic, such as the current quarter or leads with a specific status.

Refer to xref:reporting/prefilter.adoc[prefiltering] for more details.

| [#ds-load-records-presort]#<<ds-load-records-presort,Pre-sort order>>#
|
The pre-sort defines how the resulting data should be sorted before the data source returns it.
This allows you to define some initial order, such as newer leads first, or the oldest clients first.

Refer to xref:reporting/presort.adoc[presorting] for more details.

|===

[#datasource-group]
=== Group

The group data source allows you to aggregate and transform data provided by another data source, such as computing the total cost of lead acquisitions or counting the number of jobs that a client requested.

The source defines what data source is to be aggregated and it must be one of the predefined data sources such as a load or another group.

.The example shows a group data source configuration.
image:reporter/group.png[]

.Group data source configuration options:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===
| [#ds-group-group-by]#<<ds-group-group-by,Group by>>#
|
The group by section defines the columns that denote groups.
To exemplify; defining an expression of `AccountSource` for the accounts CRM module groups the records based on the account source.

The group column must define a name and an optional label and can be referenced by further data sources.

Refer to the xref:reporting/expr-reference.adoc[expression reference] for more details.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A group must define at least 1 group column.
====

| [#ds-group-aggregate]#<<ds-group-aggregate,Aggregate>>#
|
The aggregate section allows you to define how the computed columns are be evaluated.
To exemplify; defining an expression of `count()` returns the number of rows for each group.

The aggregated column must define a name and an optional label and can be referenced by further data sources.

Refer to the xref:reporting/expr-reference.adoc[expression reference] for more details.

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* reference to more examples.
====

|===

[#datasource-join]
=== Join

The join data source allows you to join two data sources based on a common value, such as a reference using `Record` module fields or a common status column.

[CAUTION]
====
The current versions do not allow you to use the join data source as an input to other data sources.
====

[CAUTION]
====
Any row from the primary source which does not have a related secondary source is omitted from the result.
Anti-joins are not supported.
====

.The example shows a join data source configuration.
image:reporter/join.png[]

.Join data source configuration options:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===
| [#ds-join-primary-source]#<<ds-join-primary-source,Primary source>>#
|
The primary source defines the base data source involved with the joining, such as the account of the account-contact relationship.

| [#ds-join-primary-column]#<<ds-join-primary-column,Primary column>>#
|
The primary column defines what column from the <<ds-join-primary-source,primary source>> should be used when determining whether the two rows are connected.

| [#ds-join-secondary-source]#<<ds-join-secondary-source,Secondary source>>#
|
The secondary source defines the data source which we are want to join to the primary source, such as the contact of the account-contact relationship.

| [#ds-join-secondary-column]#<<ds-join-secondary-column,secondary column>>#
|
The secondary column defines what column from the <<ds-join-secondary-source,secondary source>> should be used when determining whether the two rows are connected.

|===

== Display Elements

Display elements allow you to access and display the data provided by a xref:reporting/index.adoc#datasources[data source].
Display elements can only exist inside a block.
A single block may define multiple display elements.

[TIP]
====
You can use a <<el-table,table>> and a <<el-chart,chart>> side-by-side to show what data was used to generate the visualization.
====

Most display elements may define additional xref:reporting/prefilter.adoc[pre-filtering] and xref:reporting/presort.adoc[pre-sorting].

[#el-text]
=== Text

The text display element allows you to provide arbitrary content which can be used along side other display elements, providing additional context to the data.

The display element supports rich text using a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG[WYSIWYG] editor.

.The example shows a configured text display element.
image:reporter/text-configuration.png[]

.The example shows a text display element describing the chart display element.
image:reporter/text-usage-1.png[]

=== Metric

The metric display element allows you to display a calculated numerical value from the provided data source.

The calculated value is usually an indicator important to your process, such as the total finances in your sales pipeline, or the current number of open accounts.

.The example shows a configured metric display element.
image:reporter/metric-configuration.png[]

.Metric display element configuration options:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===
| [#el-metric-label]#<<el-metric-label,Label>>#
|
The label column defines what column from the data source is used when displaying the metric.
The column must be a numerical value.

| [#el-metric-format]#<<el-metric-format,Format>>#
|
Defines the formatting string that is used when displaying the metric.
The field supports all of the https://numeraljs.com/#format[numeral.js] formatting options.

The format is applied before the prefix and suffix.

| [#el-metric-pfx]#<<el-metric-pfx,Prefix>>#
|
Defines the prefix that is pre-pended to the resulting metric before it is shown in the page block.
For example, the prefix of `$` and the value of `1000` would result in the label of `$1000`.

| [#el-metric-sfx]#<<el-metric-sfx,Suffix>>#
|
Defines the suffix that is appended to the resulting metric before it is shown in the page block.
For example, the suffix of `USD/h` and the value of `1000` would result in the label of `1000USD/h`.

| [#el-metric-color]#<<el-metric-color,Text color>>#
|
Defines the text color of the displayed label.

| [#el-metric-background]#<<el-metric-background,Background color>>#
|
Defines the background color of the displayed label.

|===

=== Table

The table display element allows you to display the data source inside a table.

[NOTE]
====
If you are working with a xref:reporting/index.adoc#datasource-join[joined data source], you have to pick the columns for each joined data source.
====

.The example shows a configured table display element.
image:reporter/table-configuration.png[]

.Table display element configuration options:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===

Defines the head variant to use.

.The available variants:
* None
* Light
* Dark

| [#el-table-table-options]#<<el-table-table-options,Table options>>#
|
The section allows you to fine-tune how the table should look like; such as using a dark or light theme, removing borders, and being responsive.

|===

=== Chart

The chart display element allows you to visualize the data source using a chart.

[NOTE]
====
If you are working with a xref:reporting/index.adoc#datasource-join[joined data source], you have to pick the columns for each joined data source.
====

.Currently supported chart types:
* Bar
* Line
* Pie
* Doughnut
* Funnel

[IMPORTANT]
====
Funnel charts are only supported when showing the xref:reporting/index.adoc#datasource-group[group data source].

|
Defines what chart from the supported list of charts should be used.

| [#el-chart-scheme]#<<el-chart-scheme,Color scheme>>#
|
The color scheme defines what colors your chart should use when visualizing the data.

Keep in mind that each color scheme defines a limited number of colors so your choice needs to be based on the data you're trying to show.

Bar and line charts use a different colour for each column, while the other charts use a different color for each value.

| [#el-chart-label]#<<el-chart-label,Label column>>#
|
The label column defines what values from the data source are used as the label for each data point of the chart (the legend)..

Only text columns may be selected as a label column.
