= Reporting

{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_REPORTER} allows you to create beautiful reports using the data stored in your {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} applications.
This section focuses on the most important aspects of the system. If you wish to learn more about a specific topic, refer to the subsections under menu:Low-Code Platform Developer Guide[Reporting].

== Create a new report

To create a report, navigate to your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance (for example http://latest.cortezaproject.org/) and click ok tne "{APP_NAME_REPORTER}" application.

When you click on the btn:[New report] button, a new screen will appear asking you to provide the base report parameters.

* *Name* provides a human-friendly identifier for the report; for example "Test Report".
A name doesn't define any special constraints.
* *Handle* defines a <<report-handle-constraints,unique value>> that may be used instead of the system identifier for easier referencing.
* *Description* defines a verbose description of the report to better explain what the report shows.
* *Tags* define a series of short text snippets to describe your report.

[#report-builder]
== Report builder

The report builder is used to define the reports' structure using *report blocks* and a drag-and-drop interface.
Each report has a grid of 12 columns and is not limited on the vertical.

== Datasources

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* reference to more examples.
====

A datasoirce defines what resource we will be accessing, how the data will be pre-processed and presented to the reporter.
Most datasources may be used as the input to another datasource.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A datasource must define a name that is unique amongst other datasources defined by the current report and any of it's blocks.
====

We can define datasources on two levels: on the entire report and on a specific report block.

When defining datasources on the entire report, any of the blocks and its items will be able to access the data provided by the datasource.
Such a datasource should be used when we wish to define some pre-computed data which we will be using through the entire report.
Report-level datasources can be accessed by clicking on the btn:[Datasources] button in the top right corner of the <<report-builder,report builder>>.

When defining datasoures on specific report blocks, only the items inside the given report block will be able to access the data provided by the datasource.
Such a datasource should be used when we wish to additionally transform some pre-computed dat provided by report-level datasources.
Block-level datasources can be accessed by clicking on the "edit" icon of a certain block and navigating to the "datasources" section.

=== Load

The load datasource allows you to access resources directly from {PRODUCT_NAME} such as your CRM leads.
// Resources can be prefiltered and presorted, allowing you to show data based on a specific heuristic such as a time span.

The source defines what {PRODUCT_NAME} resource will be providing us with data; for example "compose records".

.The example shows a load datasource configuration.
image::reporter/load.png[role="data-zoomable"]

.Compose record source configuration options:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===
| [#ds-load-records-namespace]#<<ds-load-records-namespace,Namespace>>#
|
The namespace defines what {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} namespace we will be accessing; for example "CRM" or "Case Management".

| [#ds-load-records-module]#<<ds-load-records-module,Module>>#
|
The module defines what module we will be accessing; for example "lead" or "contact".

| [#ds-load-records-prefilter]#<<ds-load-records-prefilter,Prefilter>>#
|
The prefilter defines what filtering should be applied to the accessed data before the datasource returns the data.
Prefiltering allows you to show data based on the specified heuristic, such as the current quarter or leads with a specific status.

Refer to xref:reporting/prefilter.adoc[prefiltering] for more details.

| [#ds-load-records-presort]#<<ds-load-records-presort,Presort order>>#
|
The presort defines how the resulting data should be sorted before the datasource returns it.
This allows you to define some initial order, such as newer leads first, or the oldest clients first.

Refer to xref:reporting/presort.adoc[presorting] for more details

|===

[#datasource-group]
=== Group

The group datasource allows you to aggregate and transform data provided by another datasource, such as computing the total cost of lead acquisitions or counting the number of jobs that a client requested.

The source defines what datasource we will be aggregating and it must be one of the predefined datasources such as a load or another group.

.The example shows a group datasource configuration.
image:reporter/group.png[]

.Group datasource configuration options:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===
| [#ds-group-group-by]#<<ds-group-group-by,Group by>>#
|
The group by section defines the columns that denote groups.
To examplify; defining an expression of `AccountSource` for the accounts CRM module will group the records based on the account source.

The group column must define a name and an optional label; and can be referenced by further datasources.

Refer to the xref:reporting/expr-reference.adoc[expression reference] for more details.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A group must define at least 1 group column.
====

| [#ds-group-aggregate]#<<ds-group-aggregate,Aggregate>>#
|
The aggregate section allows you to define how the computed columns are be evaluated.
To examplify; defining an expression of `count()` will return the number of rows for each group.

The aggregated column must define a name and an optional label; and can be referenced by further datasources.

Refer to the xref:reporting/expr-reference.adoc[expression reference] for more details.

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* reference to more examples.
====

|===

[#datasource-join]
=== Join

The join datasource allows you to join two datasources based on a common value, such as a reference using `Record` module fields or a common status column.

[CAUTION]
====
The current versions do not allow you to use the join datasource as an input to other datasources.
====

[CAUTION]
====
Any row from the primary source which does not have a related secondary source will be omitted from the result.
Anti-joins are not supported.
====

.The example shows a join datasource configuration.
image:reporter/join.png[]

.Join datasource configuration options:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===
| [#ds-join-primary-source]#<<ds-join-primary-source,Primary source>>#
|
The primary source defines the base datasource involved with the joining, such as the account of the account-contact relationship.

| [#ds-join-primary-column]#<<ds-join-primary-column,Primary column>>#
|
The primary column defines what column from the <<ds-join-primary-source,primary source>> should be used when determining if the two rows are connected.

| [#ds-join-secondary-source]#<<ds-join-secondary-source,Secondary source>>#
|
The secondary source defines the datasource which we are trying to join to the primary source, such as the contact of the account-contact relationship.

| [#ds-join-secondary-column]#<<ds-join-secondary-column,secondary column>>#
|
The secondary column defines what column from the <<ds-join-secondary-source,secondary source>> should be used when determining if the two rows are connected.

|===

== Display elements

Display elements allow you to access and display the data provided by a xref:reporting/index.adoc#datasources[datasource].
Display elements can only exist inside a block, where a single block may define multiple display elements.

[TIP]
====
You can use a <<el-table,table>> and a <<el-chart,chart>> side-by-side to show what data was used to generate the visualization.
====

Most display elements may define additional xref:reporting/prefilter.adoc[prefiltering] and xref:reporting/presort.adoc[presorting].

[#el-text]
=== Text

The text display element allows you to provide arbitrary content which can be used along side other display elements, providing additional context to the data.

The display element supports rich text using a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG[WYSIWYG] editor.

.The example shows a configured text display element.
image:reporter/text-configuration.png[]

.The example shows a text display element describing the chart display element.
image:reporter/text-usage-1.png[]

=== Metric

The metric display element allows you to display a calculated numerical value from the provided datasource.

The calculated value is usually an indicator important to your process, such as the total finances in your sales pipeline, or the current number of open accounts.

.The example shows a configured metric display element.
image:reporter/metric-configuration.png[]

.Metric display element configuration options:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===

The column must be a numerical value.

| [#el-metric-format]#<<el-metric-format,Format>>#
|
Defines the formatting string that is used when displaying the metric.
The field supports all of the https://numeraljs.com/#format[numeral.js] formatting options.

The format is applied before the prefix and suffix.

| [#el-metric-pfx]#<<el-metric-pfx,Prefix>>#
|
Defines the prefix that is pre-pended to the resulting metric before it is shown in the page block.
For example, the prefix of `$` and the value of `1000` would result in the label of `$1000`.

| [#el-metric-sfx]#<<el-metric-sfx,Suffix>>#
|
Defines the suffix that is appended to the resulting metric before it is shown in the page block.
For example, the suffix of `USD/h` and the value of `1000` would result in the label of `1000USD/h`.

| [#el-metric-color]#<<el-metric-color,Text color>>#
|
Defines the text color of the displayed label.

| [#el-metric-background]#<<el-metric-background,Background color>>#
|
Defines the background color of the displayed label.

|===

=== Table

The table display element allows you to display the datasource inside a table.

[NOTE]
====
If you are working with a xref:reporting/index.adoc#datasource-join[joined datasource], you will have to have to pick the columns for each joined datasource
====

.The example shows a configured table display element.

|
The section allows you to fine-tune how the table should look like; such as using a dark or light theme, removing borders, and being responsive.

|===

=== Chart

The chart display element allows you to visualize the datasource using a chart.

[NOTE]
====
If you are working with a xref:reporting/index.adoc#datasource-join[joined datasource], you will have to have to pick the columns for each joined datasource
====

.Currently supported chart types:
* Bar
* Line
* Pie
* Doughnut
* Funnel

[IMPORTANT]
====
