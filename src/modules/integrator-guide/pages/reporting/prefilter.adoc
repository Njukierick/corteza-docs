= Prefilters

A prefilter allows you to define the initial filtering that should be applied to the datasource before returning any data.

The prefilter can either be provided as a configuration using the <<default,default mode>> or as an expression using the <<expression, expression mode>>.

The mode can be controlled with the "filter" icon next to the expression.


[#default]
== Default mode

The default mode allows you to pass in the prefilter as a configuration.

The third input defines the value that should be checked against the column using the specified comparator operator.

[#expression]
== Expression mode

The expression mode allows you to pass in the prefilter as an expression, allowing you to cover more complex cases.
