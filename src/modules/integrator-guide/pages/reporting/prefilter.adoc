= Pre-filters

A pre-filter allows you to define the initial filtering that should be applied to the data-source before returning any data.

The pre-filter can either be provided as a configuration using the <<default,default mode>> or as an expression using the <<expression, expression mode>>.

The mode can be controlled with the "filter" icon next to the expression.


[#default]
== Default Mode

The default mode allows you to pass in the pre-filter as a configuration.

The first input defines what column should be involved with filtering.

The second input defines the comparator operator to use.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Different column types may define different comparator operators.

The third input defines the value that should be checked against the column using the specified comparator operator.

[#expression]
== Expression Mode

The expression mode allows you to pass in the pre-filter as an expression, allowing you to cover more complex cases.

.The screenshot illustrates the pre-filter user interface with the expression mode enabled.
