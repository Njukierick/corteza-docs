== Defining password constraints

{PRODUCT_NAME} allows you to define custom password constraints which enables you to better conform to your security model.

Password constraints are configured on the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN} web application under menu:system[settings] in the "password constraints" section.

|===
| [#auth-password-constraint-len]#<<auth-password-constraint-len,Minimum length>>#
|
The minimum length parameter allows you to restrict your users from using short, insecure passwords.
You can not set the minimum length below 8.

The maximum password length is not configurable and is set to 256.

| [#auth-password-constraint-numbers]#<<auth-password-constraint-numbers,Minimum number of numbers>>#
|
The minimum number of numbers allows you to require your users to use numerical values in their passwords.
The requirement is disabled if left at 0.

| [#auth-password-constraint-symbols]#<<auth-password-constraint-symbols,Minimum number of special characters>>#
|
The minimum number of special characters allows you to require your users to use special characters in their passwords.
The requirement is disabled if left at 0.

[CAUTION]
====
The `AUTH_PASSWORD_SECURITY` `.env` variable allows you to disable password requirements checking by setting it to `false`.
This is handy for local development where we may not wish to handle complex password constraints.

The option should be *disabled* for any production deployment.
If the password security is disabled, a warning message is displayed in the UI.
